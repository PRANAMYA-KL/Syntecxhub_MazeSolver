# Syntecxhub_MazeSolver
Implemented a Maze Solver using A* Search algorithm. The maze is modeled as a grid with obstacles. Manhattan distance is used as a heuristic to find the shortest path. The program handles unreachable cases and outputs the final path.
Maze Solver using A* Search Algorithm

This project implements a maze solver using the A* search algorithm.
The maze is represented as a grid with obstacles.
The algorithm finds the shortest path using Manhattan heuristic.

Technology: Python
